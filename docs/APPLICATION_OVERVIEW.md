## Evaluation Framework

### Four-Dimension Evaluation Model

The system evaluates performance across four key dimensions, each with a specific weight in the overall evaluation:

#### 1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) - 30% weight
- Measurable outcomes and results
- Objective performance metrics
- Quantifiable achievements
- Business impact and results

#### 2. Skills and Competencies - 25% weight
- Technical skills and knowledge
- Behavioral competencies
- Communication abilities
- Problem-solving capabilities

#### 3. Key Responsibilities - 25% weight
- Job-specific duties and accountabilities
- Task completion and quality
- Reliability and dependability
- Initiative and ownership

#### 4. Company Values - 20% weight
- Alignment with organizational values
- Cultural contribution
- Teamwork and collaboration
- Ethics and integrity

### Rating Scale
The system uses a 5-point rating scale for all evaluations:

- **5 Stars (Exceptional)**: Consistently exceeds expectations, demonstrates exceptional performance
- **4 Stars (Exceeds Expectations)**: Frequently exceeds expectations, demonstrates strong performance
- **3 Stars (Meets Expectations)**: Consistently meets expectations, demonstrates solid performance
- **2 Stars (Below Expectations)**: Occasionally meets expectations, needs improvement in some areas
- **1 Star (Needs Significant Improvement)**: Does not meet expectations, requires significant development

### Evidence-Based Scoring
The system uses evidence to calculate scores for each dimension:
- Evidence entries are aggregated for each dimension
- Star ratings are averaged to create dimension scores
- Confidence factors are applied based on evidence quantity and quality
- Final scores are weighted according to the evaluation framework

## Evidence-Based Approach

### Continuous Feedback Model
Unlike traditional annual reviews, this system emphasizes continuous feedback throughout the evaluation period:

- **Real-time Feedback**: Managers provide feedback as events occur, not months later
- **Specific and Actionable**: Evidence entries include specific examples and actionable feedback
- **Multi-dimensional**: Feedback covers all aspects of job performance, not just results
- **Documented**: All feedback is recorded and can be referenced during evaluations

### Evidence Types
The system supports various types of evidence:

#### Manager Feedback
- Direct observations of performance
- Project and task completion feedback
- Behavioral observations
- Achievement recognition

#### Self-Assessment
- Employee self-reflection
- Personal achievement documentation
- Challenge identification
- Development needs assessment

#### Peer Feedback
- Collaboration feedback
- Team contribution assessment
- Communication effectiveness
- Interpersonal skills

#### Customer/Stakeholder Feedback
- External stakeholder input
- Customer satisfaction feedback
- Partner and vendor interactions
- External relationship management

### Evidence Quality
The system includes mechanisms to ensure evidence quality:

- **Specificity**: Encourages detailed, specific feedback rather than general comments
- **Timeliness**: Promotes immediate feedback rather than delayed documentation
- **Relevance**: Ensures evidence is relevant to job performance and evaluation criteria
- **Balance**: Encourages both positive feedback and constructive improvement areas
